Practice with jS - rock paper scissors

Had to reach out to Odin Project discord for help on if statement to decide win or lose in certain conditions.
It boiled down to basic use of operators. I was using = over == which overwrote the original variable set before the if statement.
After this fix, it immediately worked. This was a greate hurdle to jump over!

Next step will be to add user prompts for choice of attack, then a GUI to accompany the game, and a tracker to decide overall winner after a 5-game series.
